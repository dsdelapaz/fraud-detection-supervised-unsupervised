# Fraud Detection (Supervised and Unsupervised)
One of the projects from my graduate school. Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression (Supervised) and Decision Trees (Unsupervised)

The objective is demonstrate the ability to create and evaluate supervised and unsupervised models. Data was taken from Kaggle. Two datasets were used, one for each model. The datasets used are as follows:

Supervised model - Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset

Unsupervised model - Smart Mobility
